VERSION 1: 6/29/25 - 11:30 PM

Created a different iteration of a FastAPI - this time it is meant for fully focused
integration with Firebase and potential deployment for use with frontend applications. Currently is a clone of the previous FastAPI iteration, but with
better integration with Firebase using pydantic settings.

CHANGELOG - 6/30/25 - 11:36 PM

Implemented the GET and POST methods for the API. I also figured out the main structure for the backend Firebase database, as well as the theme of the data the API will focus on. Later goals are to implement the other methods and work towards improving their efficiency if possible. Later goals are to create a sort of API security key and potentially create and connect a frontend to this API.
