VERSION 1: 6/19/25 - 11:30 PM

Created a different iteration of a FastAPI - this time it is meant for fully focused
integration with Firebase and potential deployment for use with frontend applications. Currently is a clone of the previous FastAPI iteration, but with
better integration with Firebase using pydantic settings.
